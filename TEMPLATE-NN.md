**NUB ID:** NUB-{NN}
**Domain:** {e.g., feed rendering, chat, collaborative editing}
**Requires:** {NUB-WORD interfaces needed, e.g., NUB-RELAY, NUB-IFC}
**Discovery:** `shell.supports("{word}", "{nn}")`

## Description

{One paragraph: what message semantics this protocol defines and for what purpose. Describe the coordination pattern between napplets.}

## Message Protocol

Napplets coordinate using messages published and received via NUB-RELAY or NUB-IFC. Messages follow the NIP-5D wire format (`{ "type": "domain.action", ...payload }`). The protocol defines the semantic meaning of message content -- what napplets agree on when they exchange data.

### {Message Name}

{Description of this message type: when it is sent, what it means, who produces and consumes it.}

When published via NUB-RELAY, the event carries a NIP-01 kind, content, and tags as defined by this protocol. The payload fields and their semantics are defined here.

{Behavioral requirements for producers and consumers.}

## Negotiation

Napplets discover peers supporting this protocol via `shell.supports("{word}", "{nn}")`. A napplet requiring this protocol declares it in its manifest:

```
["requires", "{word}"]
```

The protocol number is negotiated at runtime -- the manifest declares the interface dependency, and napplets check for protocol support via `shell.supports()`.
